# ReactJS Hooks

1- useState():
The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in
functional components

2- useReducer():
useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex
state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state
depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize
performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can
pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
